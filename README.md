The course deals with computer models for biological systems that are important in a drug development context. Specifically, the focus is on models for clinical pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data. The course will also include models of systems that are of importance for preclinical research in the pharmaceutical field. Evaluation of modelling results is an important part of the course.

The course will also illustrate the use of models for addressing scientific issues and aspects of study design. Technical, mathematical and statistical aspects of model fitting and non-linear regression form an integral part of the course.
